## 1. During the Meeting: "The Cockpit"
*Designed for cognitive lightness—helping you without distracting you.*

*   **Ghost Mode HUD**: A "Heads-Up Display" that monitors your conversation health (Talk Ratio, Pace). It intelligently fades away ("Ghost Mode") when you are doing well, allowing you to focus on the person, and only reappears when you need a course correction.
*   **Real-Time Nudges**: The AI listens for specific patterns and gently nudges you if:
    *   You are interrupting too often.
    *   You are lecturing (monologuing) instead of listening.
    *   You miss an emotional cue (low empathy).
*   **Live Transcription**: Captures every word securely so you don't have to take frantic notes.

## 2. Post-Analysis: "The Game Film"
*Turning conversations into data-driven insights.*

*   **🚦 Traffic Light Assessment**: Instantly classifies the session health:
    *   **Green (Clarity Mode)**: High alignment and empathy.
    *   **Yellow (Calibration Mode)**: Good progress, but some vagueness.
    *   **Red (Intervention Mode)**: High tension or disengagement detected.
*   **🎬 Game Film Timeline**: A visual timeline of the entire meeting, marked with color-coded key moments so you can jump straight to the insights:
    *   🔴 **Risks**: Moments of tension or missed cues.
    *   🟡 **Opportunities**: Places where you could have coached better.
    *   🔵 **Key Questions**: The powerful questions you asked.
*   **📊 Performance Scorecard**: Grades your skills on **Empathy**, **Clarity**, and **Listening**, comparing them to your historical average.
*   **✉️ One-Tap Follow-Up**: The AI extracts "Decisions Made" and "Action Items" and instantly drafts a professional follow-up email for your team. You can copy and send it in seconds.
*   **Deep Dive Analytics**: Tracks your long-term trends in Sentiment, Goal Completion, and Speaking Time Distribution.

*Learning doesn't stop when the meeting ends.*

*   **Daily Wisdom Feed**: A curated stream of high-quality leadership articles from sources like *Harvard Business Review*, *First Round Review*, and *McKinsey*.
*   **AI "Golden Nuggets"**: Don't have time to read? The AI reads the article for you and extracts a single **"Golden Nugget"** (one actionable tip) and 3 key takeaways.
*   **Social Sharing**: Easily share these insights with your team to foster a culture of learning.

## 4. Practice Arena
*   **AI Roleplay**: A safe space to practice difficult conversations (e.g., "Salary Negotiation," "Giving Tough Feedback") with an AI persona that reacts realistically to your words.
